# Top rated articles from Hacker news
-------------------------------------

Hello!
Here you can find my small project that will revert all  top rated articles from the first two pages of Hacker news website. All the articles will be sorted by the number of votes(from the largest amount to the smallest, where smallest must be > 99 votes). 
For this simple project I used Python with some modules: requests, bs4 and pprint.
